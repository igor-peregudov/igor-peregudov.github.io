                <p>June 22, 1941 in the twilight of the pre-dawn sky, the border guards saw strange, floating lights from the west. With their approach, the roar of many engines grew. And in moments - the thunder of explosions, howling sea of fire... In it, cut off from the army and the rear, surrounded by invaders, was Brest Fortress. There was no reliable information about her fate, but from all over the huge front from the Baltic to the Black Sea the word was passed from mouth to mouth: the fascist armada was advancing to the east, and in the deep rear of the fortress a handful of brave men had been fighting for over a month ... For three years a fortress was turned into ruins, liberators. July 28, 1944 over Bug the silence of the front line was established. </p>
